Archive snapshot — 2026-01-16

This branch is a placeholder that documents the repository cleanup: example/reference folders have been moved out of the active tree to reduce CI/test noise and dependency churn.

Items the user moved locally (not tracked in this commit):
- Core Examples/
- Example agents from mini/
- Example MCP SERVER/
- Example camera creenshots/
- Examples of kernels/
- Examples of share realization technichues/
- Examples of tests/
- Examples of vision/
- EXample llanaccp/
- Ideas of referrence/
- TensorRT-LLM/
- Voice Examples/

Notes:
- The `models/` folder was intentionally left in place by the user and is NOT archived here.
- These items were untracked in the repository at the time of this branch, so the actual file moves were performed locally by the user prior to this archive branch being created.

If you believe any of these items should be preserved in the repo instead of archived, please note it in the PR and we can adjust.
